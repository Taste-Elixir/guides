Coach: Explain briefly these two ways of communication on the web, via websockets and HTTP.

Channels - Setting up Channels","type":"extras","doc":"Phoenix includes a built-in mix task for channels that will create files and do some of the boilerplate work for you. We will need to pass a name into our command, that’s why we will follow the Slack theme, and call it general. Look out for any actions that the terminal asks you to complete. $ mix phx.gen.channel general In lib/workshops_app_web/channels/user_socket.ex add the following below the ## Channels comment. ## Channels # channel &quot;room:*&quot;, WorkshopsAppWeb.RoomChannel channel &quot;general:lobby&quot;, WorkshopsAppWeb.GeneralChannel In our lib/workshops_app_web/channels/general_channel.ex we should have the following content: defmodule WorkshopsAppWeb.GeneralChannel do use WorkshopsAppWeb, :channel def join(&quot;general:lobby&quot;, payload, socket) do if authorized?(payload) do {:ok, socket} else {:error, %{reason: &quot;unauthorized&quot;}} end end # Channels can be used in a request/response fashion # by sending replies to requests from the client def handle_in(&quot;ping&quot;, payload, socket) do {:reply, {:ok, payload}, socket} end # It is also common to receive messages from the client and # broadcast to everyone in the current topic (general:lobby). def handle_in(&quot;shout&quot;, payload, socket) do broadcast socket, &quot;shout&quot;, payload {:noreply, socket} end # Add authorization logic here as required. defp authorized?(_payload) do true end end Now that we have generated some code let&#39;s look at what it does. First the general_channel.ex is the channel equivalent of a controller in Phoenix, being that it handles websocket requests instead of http requests. On line 2 :channel is referring to the Phoenix channel function from user_socket.ex file. It takes a parameter which is used as a namespace for the websocket connections. In this instance the namespace is &quot;general:lobby&quot;. The next argument WorkshopsAppWeb.GeneralChannel is made up of two parts. The first part WorkshopsAppWeb is the name of the app with -Web as suffix indicating that we have separate directory containing all the abstractions related to communication with outside world . The second part is GeneralChannel. This is the name of the module that handles the logic related to any communication through this channel. In Phoenix, it’s conventional to namespace all your modules with your app name first as this prevents namespace errors. The file, user_socket.ex, is like the router.ex file, but for channels. The topic, for us it&#39;s general, allows clients, also known as web browsers, to subscribe to the channel. In the same way a path in a web request directs the request to the right controller, the topic directs the socket to the right module, in this case, WorkshopsAppWeb.GeneralChannel. Now, let’s look at the join function at line 4. def join (&quot;general:lobby&quot;, payload, socket) do: takes three arguments. The first argument, the name of the channel, &quot;general:lobby&quot;, makes it so that this function is only called when the client is joining the specific channel. The second argument, payload is the request from the user; it can contain auth credentials, a message or anything the user wants. Finally, it takes socket, which is the websocket connection. There’s a call to authorized? function, which always returns true. Then, {:ok, socket} just returns a status and the websocket they are connecting to. join function always returns {:ok, socket} to allow all connections to connect to the channel. Once a user joins a channel they can send messages to the channel and they’ll be received by one of the handle_in messages. The first one just returns the payload sent by the user back to them. The second one sends the payload to all the users subscribed to the channel. It’s the second one that allows us to build our chat room with just a little frontend work. When you send a message to the chat room, this function sends it back to you and to everyone else in the channel. To handle the connections on the Client-side we’ll start by adding jQuery to our app. First of all let&#39;s install it via npm command inside assets/ directory: cd assets/ npm install jquery --save Then we need to let our bundle know that we want to include newly installed library to final build. To achieve that we need to visit assets/webpack.config.js config file and add following. On top of the config file const Webpack = require(&#39;webpack&#39;); Then we need to update plugins section one the bottom of this file. It should look like that: plugins: [ new MiniCssExtractPlugin({ filename: &#39;../css/app.css&#39; }), new CopyWebpackPlugin([{ from: &#39;static/&#39;, to: &#39;../&#39; }]), new Webpack.ProvidePlugin({ $: &#39;jquery&#39;, jQuery: &#39;jquery&#39;, &#39;window.jQuery&#39;: &#39;jquery&#39; }) ] Phoenix comes with a simple javascript socket client, but it’s disabled by default. Go into your assets/js/app.js and uncomment the last line: import socket from &quot;./socket&quot; Then go into your assets/js/socket.js and paste the following: socket.connect() let channel = socket.channel(&quot;general:lobby&quot;, {}); let list = $(&#39;#message-list&#39;); let message = $(&#39;#message&#39;); let name = $(&#39;#name&#39;); message.on(&#39;keypress&#39;, event =&gt; { if (event.keyCode == 13) { channel.push(&#39;shout&#39;, { name: name.val(), message: message.val() }); message.val(&#39;&#39;); } }); channel.on(&#39;shout&#39;, payload =&gt; { list.append(`&lt;b&gt;${payload.name || &#39;Anonymous&#39;}:&lt;/b&gt; ${payload.message}&lt;br&gt;`); list.prop({scrollTop: list.prop(&quot;scrollHeight&quot;)}); }); channel.join() .receive(&quot;ok&quot;, resp =&gt; { console.log(&quot;Joined successfully&quot;, resp) }) .receive(&quot;error&quot;, resp =&gt; { console.log(&quot;Unable to join&quot;, resp) }) socket.channel(&quot;general:lobby&quot;, {}) sends the join request to the server, and the server sends the message back to the client. Here, we listen for a keypress event on the message text field. Whenever the user enters a message, it’s pushed on the channel and the text field is cleared. When there’s an incoming message on the channel, it’s appended to the div we previously created and scrolled to the bottom. Next we will want to create the container for our messages. Open lib/workshops_app_web/templates/page/index.html.eex, and replace its contents with: &lt;div id=&#39;message-list&#39; class=&#39;row&#39;&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&#39;row form-group&#39;&gt; &lt;div class=&#39;col-md-3&#39;&gt; &lt;input type=&#39;text&#39; id=&#39;name&#39; class=&#39;form-control&#39; placeholder=&#39;Name&#39; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&#39;col-md-9&#39;&gt; &lt;input type=&#39;text&#39; id=&#39;message&#39; class=&#39;form-control&#39; placeholder=&#39;Message&#39; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; What we have done here is create an empty div that will list all the chat messages and added two text fields, one for the user’s name and one for the message. Now you will want to open assets/css/app.css and paste this at the end: #message-list { border: 1px solid #777; height: 400px; padding: 10px; overflow: scroll; margin-bottom: 50px; } Now go to http://localhost:4000 and see the results!

So we’ll update our handler to: def handle_in(&quot;shout&quot;, payload, socket) do spawn(WorkshopsApp.Conversations, :create_message, [payload]) broadcast! socket, &quot;shout&quot;, payload {:noreply, socket} end What this does is spawn an elixir process to do the save, outside of the request cycle.

You might have a look on the documentation of FileReader. We will add following line to initiate it: var filereader = new FileReader(); Now, we need to modify an event handler, that waits on pressing &quot;ENTER&quot;. Replace it with the following code: filereader.readAsDataURL($(&quot;#file-input&quot;).prop(&#39;files&#39;)[0]); filereader.onload = function () { channel.push(&#39;shout&#39;, { name: name.val(), message: message.val(), file: filereader.result }); message.val(&#39;&#39;); } Go to the file: lib/workshops_app_web/channels/general_channel.ex and add a following line to the function, handling messages: IO.inspect(payload, label: &quot;PAYLOAD&quot;) Now, let&#39;s try to send a message with a photo or a GIF. After this step, we should see a content of the file. Maybe you want to check the content of other variables with use of IO.inspect function? Coach: Explain, when you usually use IO.inspect function."},{"ref":"6-uploads.html#receiving-the-file","title":"6.
